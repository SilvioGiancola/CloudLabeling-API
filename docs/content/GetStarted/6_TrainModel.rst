How to Train a Model
================

Once you have annotated at least a couple of images, you can close your project, and start a training on the main landing pages with all your projects.

.. image:: ./image/3_CreateProject.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Alternative text

The interface will inform you whether it is currently training, the estimated time for the training of the model, and when was the last training performed.
